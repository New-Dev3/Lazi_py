# ChaiPy

A developer interface for creating chatbots for the Chai app.




## Requirements
Python 3.7 is required due to the usage of `dataclasses`.

Manual workarounds exist (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1868714)), enabling the potential support of earlier 
versions of Python. Other potential limiting factors include the use of `asyncio.run()`, and of `async` in general.
